Why should we set up a Python environment?

There can be times when you could face incompatibility issues between the packages installed on your system and the packages recommended to run Jupyter notebook codes used in Quantra courses. To remove these incompatibility issues, you simply have to set up the Python environment by following the steps mentioned below. 
 
We recommend using the Anaconda and Jupyter notebook for an optimum user experience. 
 
Note that each step mentioned below is important to run the codes without any error. If you have already installed the correct version of Anaconda then you can directly go to the second step to set up the Python environment.
 
1. Install Anaconda
2. Set up the Python environment
 
 
Install Anaconda
Anaconda offers different installations on different architectures such as 32-bit and 64-bit. Therefore it is important to check the system configuration before installing Anaconda.

 
Set up the Python Environment
After installing Anaconda, when you open the Anaconda prompt, you will see "base" written on the left-hand side. That is the default environment.
 
 
What happens if you close everything and come back after two days, wanting to try another strategy?
 
Remember that you should always open the Anaconda prompt or terminal and type the following command "conda activate <<name of your environment>>" to start the custom python environment suitable for Quantra codes. For example, if the name of your environment is quantra_py, then you can type "conda activate quantra_py".
